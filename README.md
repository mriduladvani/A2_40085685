This assignment consists of a normal server that caters to the requests sent by the user (get/post) as the user would send in a browser.
This project also includes a file server that lets the user to list all the files in a specific directory (the only directory he has an access to), read the contents of a particular file and write some content on a file that already exists (and if it doesn't, the file gets created and then the data is written)
The scripts for each of them are:

Client sending requests: clientns.py
Normal server: https.py
Client sending file access requests: clientfs.py
File Server: httpfs.py

For Usage, see the argparse requests type in the script.
